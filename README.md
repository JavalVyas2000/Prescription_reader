# Prescription_reader

Prescription reader uses tesseract-OCR to convert the images to strings and this was developed keeping in mind the healthcare industry where the prescriptions would be scanned and the patient's history will be updated on a database making it easier for a new doctor to know the patient's history. The application is fairly rudimentary as it was developed as a part of a hackathon, but the future application could include using deep learning techniques to assist the classical OCR perform better. This application currently has certain constraints, one of which is that user has to scan the text in a well lit environment and text should not be written on a ruled peice of paper. This could be modified in the future iterations of the project.
